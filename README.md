# Visualizing-Earnings-Based-on-College-Majors

In this project, I'll explore how using the pandas plotting functionality along with the Jupyter notebook interface allows us to explore data quickly using visualizations. 

I'll be working with a dataset on the job outcomes of students who graduated from college between **2010** and **2012**. The original data on job outcomes was released by [American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/), which conducts surveys and aggregates the data. FiveThirtyEight cleaned the dataset and released it on their [Github repo](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors).
